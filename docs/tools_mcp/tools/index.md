# 🛠️ Tools

In Railtracks, **tools** are capabilities that agents can call—functions, other agents, or external systems. This makes them composable, flexible, and powerful in multi-agent workflows.

Whether you're looking to expose your Python functions to agents, wrap other agents as tools, or explore advanced use cases like dynamic tool routing and function schemas—this section has you covered.
